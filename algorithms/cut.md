# CUT

In CUT, we sample a 2x2 window and we extract their luma value.

```
P05 -- P06
 |      |
P09 -- P10
```

## Edge detection

Using this window, we are able to detected only edges of 45Â°.

We detect an edge when the luma difference on one diagonal is much smaller compared to the other.

## Triangulation / Pattern Recognition

Let's keep focusing on the center square.

If we ignore symmetries and consider the edges we detected in the previous step, we're basically guaranteed to fall into one of these patterns:

## Interpolation

We are now left with a set of triangles and quads that we need to interpolate.

Using the center square pixels and the current coordinates, we apply the symmetry transformations found in the previous step.

For each pattern, we defined a set of rules that will output two line segments with associated colors from the center square at the extremities.

We can now assume we have a blend function ```blend(A, B, t)``` that mixes the colors, given a parameter representing the relative distance between the two points.

For every point of our figure, we are now able to find the projection on those segments and compute the color using the ```blend``` function.

If ```blend``` is defined as the simple interpolation formula, we'll inevitably blur the colors. We want edge to be sharp and gradients to be smooth. To achieve that, we can use a function that behaves as a step if the difference in luma is high and fall back to linear interpolation when it's low.
